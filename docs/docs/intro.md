# Git URL Parse

<img src="img/logo.png" align="left" width="20%" height="20%" />

This project is a golang port of an old project of mine [git-url-parse][], which
was donated to [coala][], and partially inspired by [go-git-url][].

It's usefulness may be limited, but I have a [fascination][] with revisiting old
projects.
